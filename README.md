# JoeCool_WeatherService

## Description

As part of week 6 challenge, I'm tasked with providing a weather forcasting app to include the days forecast and the next 5 upcoming days. When the searching for a city, the city searched is saved in the local storage for future reference. Data that is provided includes date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.  

## Installation

No installation is required. This is a web based tool and can be accessed through [JoeCool_WeatherService](https://joecool-engineer.github.io/JoeCool_WeatherService/).

## Usage

Visit the [JoeCool_WeatherService](https://joecool-engineer.github.io/JoeCool_WeatherService/) and provide the city name that you would you like to inquire the weather. The city searched should be saved below the search button for future reference.

## Credits

The main page and styling was provided by University of Arizona coding bootcamp. However, the functionality was provided by JoeCool himself. Enjoy!
